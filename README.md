# AI Internship Notifier 🔔

This is a real-time internship workflow automation project built using:

- 🔵 Replit – frontend form

- 🟠 n8n – automation logic
- 🔴 Telegram – instant alerts

## 🔧 How it works

1. Student submits profile through Replit form
2. Data is stored in Airtable
3. n8n automation sends profile data to Telegram in real-time

## 📁 Folders

- `n8n-workflow/` – exported .json of the full automation
- `airtable/` – field structure and sample data
- `telegram-setup.md` – optional setup instructions for the bot
